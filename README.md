How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By asking qualifiying 

By asking qualifying questions that are geared around the idea of the three main aspects of the stories such as “As a”, ”I want to”, ”So that I can.” Well thought out questions can lead into further discussions on what the stakeholders need from their program and give more insight for the developers.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I hope to encorperate the sprints aspects of the development cycle so I can properly plan my code while giving myself the ability to make changes that may arise. That time would also give me the ability to try new things to fail and then succeed. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is being available for help while also maintaining a high level of "done." It it also important to take ownership of your code and admit mistakes. Giving praise is also important for instance giving fellow developers praise during stand ups for helping with problems that may have been persisting.
